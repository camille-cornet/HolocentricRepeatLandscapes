# Holocentric Repeat Landscapes

Scripts for the article "Holocentric repeat landscapes: from microevolutionary patterns to macroevolutionary associations with karyotype evolution"

Cornet, C., Mora, P., Augustijnen, H., Nguyen, P., Escudero, M., & Lucek, K. (2023). Holocentric repeat landscapes: From micro-evolutionary patterns to macro-evolutionary associations with karyotype evolution. Molecular Ecology, 00, 1–19. https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.17100

The bash scripts (A1 to A5) are given for the interspecific analyses of the repeat landscape in 14 _Carex_ species. The same scripts were used for the analyses on _Erebia_ butterflies.
